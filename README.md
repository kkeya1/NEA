## NEA
Basic implementation of Neural Embedding Allocation (NEA) in **Kamrun Naher Keya, Yannis Papanikolaou, and James Foulds. Neural Embedding Allocation: Distributed Representations of Topic Models. The Computational Linguistics Journal, ACL, 2022.**

Simple python script is provided to train NEA. Run the Python file: "Train_NEA.py"

The model will train on pre-trained LDA parameters: document-topic distribution and word-topic distribution. 
Pre-trained LDA parameters on NIPS corpus for K=50 is provided in the "LDA-Parameters" folder.

NIPS corpus with its dictionary file is provided in the "data" folder. Data is required only 
for evaluation purpose (not for training NEA model).
